# Python tool to convert regular image into ascii art
## This projet is just to knock the rust off my python. None of the code is original, credit is given to the authors of [Python Playground](https://nostarch.com/python-playground-2nd-edition).

## Update: I have made a slight original modification so that this just prints the product in the terminal instead of an outfile.
